# DEFCON SPEAKER OPS Instructions

## DEFCON 29 (2021 - Can't Stop the Signal)
The DEFCON team has decided to use Streamlabs OBS (SLOBS) this year, the updated instructions can be found in the [DC29_SAFEMODE_WITH_NETWORKING](DC29_SAFEMODE_WITH_NETWORKING) directory

NOTE: SLOBS is unsupported on Linux, so we made a workaround for Linux users using OBS. That said, SLOBS is a more straightforward process and we recommend recording your talk using SLOBS on either a Windows or Mac OS.
